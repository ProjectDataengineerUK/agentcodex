# Project AGENTS

## Purpose

This project is initialized with AgentCodex.

Use AgentCodex as the workflow and domain guidance layer for Codex-based development.

## Operating Rules

1. Use `AGENTS.md` as the project instruction baseline.
2. Keep workflow artifacts in `.agentcodex/`.
3. Prefer local knowledge in `.agentcodex/kb/` before external sources when the topic is covered there.
4. Use the workflow in this order unless there is a good reason not to:
   - brainstorm
   - define
   - design
   - build
   - ship
5. Record verification in `.agentcodex/reports/`.
6. Use `.agentcodex/commands/` for project-local procedure docs that replace slash-command assumptions.

## AgentCodex Project Standard

- validacao
- observabilidade
- access control
- data contracts
- operacao
- deploy
- custo
- compliance
